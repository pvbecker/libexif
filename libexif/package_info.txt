Description: libexif
 This library is a first attempt on generating something like Phil Harvey's exiftool, but in both
 static and shared library formats, in order to more easily have access to image metadata on certain
 environments, when either we don't have access to exiftool's executable or don't want to pipe it's
 output to our program.
